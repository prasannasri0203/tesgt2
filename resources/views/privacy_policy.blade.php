<p class="font-weight-bold para">We may modify this Privacy Notice at any time by posting a new version at www.zakah-network.com,
effective on the date of publication. Your continued use of the Zakah Network constitutes acceptance of our latest Privacy Notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-4">SCOPE OF NOTICE</h4>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">This Privacy Notice is intended to help you understand what information we (The Zakah Network) collect from you, how we use that information and when we use it.
The Zakah Network is also committed to ensuring the security and privacy of any collected data.</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">The Zakah Network is a data processor and does not own the information you submit through our portal. We temporarily house the data on our secure cloud system for purposes of Zakah fraud reduction and cumulative insights about the general Zakah population.
The Masjid to which you submit your application owns your data and can retain your data according to its own data retention policies.
Please contact the Masjid from which you receive Zakah about their data retention policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-4">INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">The Zakah Network and its 3rd party affiliates collect your name, address, phone number, personal photo, and ID card photo in order to provide Zakah verification and application services to member Masjids. Additionally,
we collect data about your insurance status, household size, supporting documentation, and other demographic background data.
This additional data will be referred to as “demographic data” for the remainder of this notice.</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">Your name, address, phone number, and demographic data remains on file with our system for a period of two years from the date of your last Zakah application. After two years, your data is deleted from our system.</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">Your photo/biometric data is temporarily stored and is deleted within 48 hours of submitting your Zakah application. The data includes, but is not limited to, the images and/or videos of the end-user’s identity documents (e.g. passport, ID card, or driving license),
their biometric facial identifiers (e.g. face images and/or videos), and the textual information that is either extracted directly from the end-user’s identity particulars or is provided by the end-user at each step of the verification process.</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">Please note that when you browse our website (www.zakah-network.com), we may collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device you are using, cookies (small files that we embed on your computer, only if you consent to it) to enable our systems to recognize your browser and capture and retain certain information.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-4">INFORMATION USES AND DISCLOSURES</h4>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">Your name, address, phone number, and demographic data are shared with subscribing Masjids for a period of two years. The Masjid to which you submit your Zakah application retains your Zakah application according to its own data retention policies that are separate from the Zakah Network.
We do not share or sell you photo, photo ID, or other biometric data with Masjids.</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">Upon receipt of a lawful court order or subpoena, we will turn over your name, address, phone number, and demographic data to law enforcement. If we receive a lawful court order or subpoena within 48 hours of your application, we will also turn over your photo/biometric data and picture of your photo ID to law enforcement.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-4">USER CHOICES</h4>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">You are not required to submit any information through the Zakah Network online portal in order to receive Zakah. You may directly go to the Masjid to which you are applying for Zakah and physically request a paper copy of your Zakah application should one be available. Please note that this process is separate from the Zakah Network and individual Masjid policies apply.
Please be aware of increased processing times associated with paper Zakah applications.</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">You may also adjust your browser setting to limit cookie acceptance options.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-4">CORRECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

Once registered, you may access your information for up to 12 months before having to re-register. If you are unable to correct you information, please submit requests with supporting documentation to support@zakah-network.com and title your email “Personal data correction request for – Your first and last name” For example,
the email subject could read “Personal data correction request for – Khalid Smith”</p>

<div class="content">
<h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-4">CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h4>
<p class="font-weight-bold para">Our Services are not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18).
